## Project Overview

Income Tax Calculator is a website that aims to provide the user with a simple way of determining how much taxes they owe the government annually. This only applies to Swedish users. 
The website offers four tax brackets which the user might fall into, which are based on data from 2016, found on [Wikipedia](https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skatt_i_Sverige): 

The first bracket is for those that earn less than 18800 SEK, which excludes them from paying income taxes. 

The second is for those that earn more than 18800 SEK and less than 443200 SEK, which results in a standard income tax of 31%.

The third is for those that earn more than 443200 SEK but less than 638800 SEK, which results in a standard 31% income tax and then a 20% tax on the surplus. 

The fourth is for those that earn more than 638800SEK SEK, which results in a standard 31% income tax and then a 25% tax on the surplus. 

This site has been created as part of my second project for Code Institute.

## Strategy <a name="strategy"></a>

### Project Goals <a name="project-goals"></a>

The goal of this website is to provide the user a simple way of determining annual income taxes owed to the Swedish government. 

The target audience of this website are Swedish inhabitants that want an easy way to calculate the annual income taxes owed. 

### User Intention <a name="user-intention"></a>

* __App User Goals:__

    * I want to get an estimation of how much taxes I owe the government.
    * I want to be able to know under which tax bracket I fall into.

* __App Owner Goals:__

    * I want to provide a website allowing the user to calculate their annual income taxes owed to the Swedish government.

## Scope <a name="scope"></a>

To achieve the goals set for this project, I will implement the following features:

* A function that will calculate the annual income taxes in Sweden.
* An if/else statement that seperates the income into four categories, or tax brackets, which has been explained in the 'project overview'.
* An event listener, that listens for the input value added into the income input field. Without it, the website's purpose is void. 

## Design <a name="design"></a>

The design of this project is extremely simple, as this is a website that only offers one usage. As such, there is no further need for customization. 

## Features <a name="features"></a>

### Current Features <a name="current-features"></a>

__Main__:

The taxCalculate function is the only function found in this project. When this function runs, it calculates the income tax based on an if/else statement. If the user enters a value higher than a specific bracket, then a certain else if statement is executed depending on the value that they entered. There is also another if/else statement that is used to calculate the annual net income of the user. 

### Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

Due to the short amount of time, and illness when this project began, there was not enough time to implement addtional features.

* A code to javascript that hides the 'How to use' section in a tab that opens and closes. This way the content detailing how the website functions can be hidden away until the user decides to open it. 

## Technologies Used <a name="tech-used"></a>

For this project, the languages used are HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Testing <a name="testing"></a>

### Website Usage <a name="website-usage"></a>

When the user uses the website, they enter a value in the first input field titled 'income:". They are also presented with a 'How to use:' section that explains how to use the website. 

The image shows that if the user enters a value that is lower than 18800 SEK, the 'Tax Calculated' field will not show any data. 

Screenshot of the first tax bracket:

If the user enters a value equal to or greater than 18800 SEK but less than 443200 SEK, then a standard income tax of 31% is applied.

Screenshot of the second tax bracket:

![](assets/images/second-tax-bracket.png)


As demonstrated in the second and third tax brackets, the percentage of income tax changes if the users enters a value that is equal or more than 443200 SEK

Screenshot of the third tax bracket:

If the user enters a value that is equal to or greater tha 638800 SEK, than the fourth tax bracket will be applied.

This app was tested on the following browsers:

* Google Chrome
* Safari 

The app has also been used on different devices, such as:

* PC desktop
* iPhone 12 Pro
* MacBook Pro

### Known Bugs and Fixes <a name="bugs-fix"></a>

* During testing the app with Lighthouse, an issue arose where Lighthouse could not test the performance of the website. After looking into the Javascript file and CSS file, I noticed that the fadein styling element was the issue. After deleting that element, Lighthouse could test the performance of the website without any further issues.

## Code Content <a name="code-content"></a>

* The script.js document was created using the following [yunzen's](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52874066/calculating-tax-using-javascript
) website tutorial, with adjustments by me. More specifically yunzen's answer. I then added my own code for the function, so that it would execute the different tax brackets.
